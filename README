Description : Tickler, a straight-to-the-point task manager based on the GTD method

More info:
GTD is a powerful method to manage commitments, information, and communication.

This app's goals are to:

*Allow the user to enter a task in mere seconds without devoting much attention to it.
*Don’t require prior knowledge of GTD except if absolutely necessary. The application must process the tasks whenever possible.
*Show the user the relevant information don’t distract him with the irrelevant. Do not focus on "what he must do", but on "what he can do"; that is more useful.
